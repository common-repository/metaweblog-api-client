ABOUT

  Blogger API Client is a WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to add,
  edit, and delete your Blogger API service posts directly from WordPress.
  This is often called 'cross-posting.'  You need an account on whatever
  service you intend to post to to use this plugin.

  Blogger API Client's home on the web can be found at
    http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/bac/
  It was written for part of the MIT CSAIL Decentralized Information Group
  infrastructure.  DIG can be found at

  Consult INSTALL for directions on how to install this plugin.

  Please inform me of any global configuration variables it would help you
  to have.
