INSTALLATION

  This is a two step process.  You should have a text editor at hand,
  along with access to the WordPress database and a browser.  This
  pertains to Blogger API Client, version 0.1 and up.


  Step 1: Add the Blogger API Client database table.

  From the command line, execute the following command

	% mysql -u <user> <database> [-p] < bac-data.sql

  Your system may vary; you may not need a password (the '-p' portion).
  I don't know your machine.  Check in your wp-config.php file if you've
  forgotten these parameters.


  Step 2: Move the plug-in file, activate.

  Move the bac/ directory to your wp-content/plugins directory.  Then
  move bac/bac.php down directly into the wp-content/plugins directory.

  Edit it and find the configuration section right below all the
  plugin information.  It looks like this:

   // You must fill out these parameters for your Blogger API account before
   // the plugin will activate properly.
   $bac_username   = "yourusername";
   $bac_password   = "yourpassword";
   $bac_server     = "hostname";      // e.g., www.blogger.com
   $bac_path       = "/service/path"; // e.g., /api

  Change the settings according to your account and the Blogger API
  service you intend to use; it won't work unless you fill in all of the
  correct configuration information.

  Browse over to http://yoursite.example.org/wp-admin/plugins.php and
  find the Blogger API Client plugin.  Hit 'Activate,' and you're ready
  to go.

  [CONDITIONAL]
  Your service may require a key, and you may want to specify which blog
  amongst several under your username; these two configuration variables
  will help you do that.

    $bac_key      = "";  // Blogger key, 0213456789ABCDEF
    $bac_blogid   = "";  // Blog ID if you have several


  [optional] Step 3:

  You can post entries only from certain categories.  If you don't
  care about this function, skip this step.

  In the administrative interface, find or create categories that
  you'd like to use and remember the numerical ID associated with
  each.

  Find this line in bac.php, under the previous configuration options.

   // example using IDs 1 and 2: $bac_category = array("1", "2");
   $bac_category = array();

  As in the commented example, add your desired IDs to the array.
  Now only those posts in the categories you designated will be
  cross posted.


  [optional] Step 4: Enable urlparse support

  When cross posting, your non-absolute URL's may break (those that don't
  start with 'http://').  To filter content such that all links are
  transformed into absolute URL's, download the urlparse plug-in
  (http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/urlparse/) and activate it.  This is not
  bundled with BAC because of licensing constraints.  As a plug-in, it does
  not actively do anything, it merely provides functions that other code
  can call upon.

  Open up bac.php in your editor and find the following two commented
  lines:

    //!!!uncomment for urlparse support
    //$content = urlparse_external_links($content, $ID);

  and remove the two slashes from the beginning of the second line.
